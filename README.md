Greetings everyone!!

This is a basic Drawing board application that allows to draw with colors and sizes of brush, erase and share the project.
It is developed in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Android Studio was used for the development of the tools.

To use it in your application, copy the 'MainActivity.kt', 'DrawingView.kt' and the app level gradle file or use the code base entirely.

Feel free to suggest some improvements.
