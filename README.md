Greetings!!

This is a basic drawing board application that allows to draw using brush of different sizes and color, erase and share using other applications.
It is entirely developed in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

The development Environment was provided by Android Studio.

If you wish to use the project then copy the "MainActivity.kt", "DrawingView.kt" and app level gradle file. You can also use the entire codebase (PS: Delete .idea folder)

Feel free to suggest some changes.
